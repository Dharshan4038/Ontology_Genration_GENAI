Many software developments, testing and test case generation approaches have evolved in last two decades to deliver quality products and services. Testing plays a vital role to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. In this paper authors attempted to conduct a systematic study of testing tools and techniques. Six most popular e-resources called IEEE, Springer, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Elsevier, Wiley and Google Scholar to download 738 manuscripts out of which 125 were selected to conduct the study. Out of 125 manuscripts selected, a good number approx. 79% are from reputed journals and around 21% are from good conference of repute. Testing tools discussed in this paper have broadly been divided into five different categories: open source, academic and research, commercial, academic and open source, and commercial & open source. The paper also discusses several benchmarked datasets viz. Evosuite 10, SF100 Corpus, Defects4J repository, Neo4j, JSON, Mocha JS, and Node JS to name a few. Aim of this paper is to make the researchers aware of the various test case generation tools and techniques introduced in the last 11 years with their salient features. Keywords- Software testing, Test case generation, Test data, Software reliability, Software engineering. 1. Introduction Software industry is very dynamic, uncertain and volatile, since 19th century to till date new software trends are taking place to meet the growing needs of customers. But throughout this tenure, the quality and reliability of software have always been a prime focus. The increasing dependency of society on the daily use of the software is making software reliability a more important aspect. The reliability of software mainly depends on software testing. Better software testing may lead to more reliable software. Software Testing is a process of applying existing or new test cases on software for verification during development and for validation of functionality before release. Testing time is an essential key factor that depends on the scope and complexity of the software. It is identified that testing consumes more than 50% software development time as it involves various activities. Testing activities include the following tasks: generation of test cases, forming test suites, execution of test suites, analyze the results of the execution and prepare the report of testing activity (Baresi and Pezzè, 2006; Setiani et al., 2019). ME Verma et al.: Software Test Case Generation Tools and Techniques: A Review 294 | Vol. 8, No. 2, 2023 The main of test case generation is to make test suites for detecting bugs in the software. These test cases and test suites will ensure that the system satisfies the reliability, standards, and customer requirements of the software. The test case generation approach contains four main activities: information artifacts, generation mechanism, test case validity and formation of test oracle. These activities are used to represent the basic test case generation process shown in Figure 1 (Clark et al., 2021). Figure 1. Basic test case generation process. In practicality, a test case generator is a software program that takes a source code of software to be tested, test case validation criteria, test case specifications and basic data structure definitions of test cases as input parameters and generates test cases as output. Test case generation algorithms use heuristics or some explicit strategy to generate test cases which maximize code coverage or fault coverage capabilities of test cases. According to literature , generating accurate test cases which can fulfil the test requirements is not an easy task (Narciso et al., 2014). In last decade so many researches have been done in the area of test case generation. So, it became necessary to review these important literatures for better classification of approaches and identification of research gaps. This paper provides a systematic review to present a broad overview of the existing literature on test case generation tools and techniques since 2011. The motivation behind the paper is to focus on evidences for identification of research gap in test case generation tools and techniques. To perform the review process, authors have included almost all the important literature and presented them in a well-organized manner. This review has been conducted on a set of 125 papers published in conference and journals of repute between year 2011 and 2021. The selection of these papers is done using multistage selection criteria in the field of test suite generation. Followed by introduction, the structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2, describes the research methods for systematic mapping of existing work which includes the process of review, research questions, search criteria, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and selection procedure for research articles. Section 3 discussed the results and provide the answers of research questions with proper evidences. At last, Section 4 presented the conclusions of the systematic review as well as identifies the future scope for the current study. ME Test Data validity Test Case] Test Casc?

Research Methods for Systematic Mapping of Literature Review In last decade, researchers have contributed a lot on test case generation to make the generation process more efficient and truly automated. Systematic review is the way to look back to the studies. It is a rigorous and consistent practice for identifying and classifying related research as much as possible and also focus on selection of relevant findings, analyse data, and perform evaluation or assessment (de Almeida Biolchini et al., 2007). There are some slandered guidelines to conduct systematic review, such guidelines provide the steps to perform systematic review. The authors have followed these guidelines conduct an effective systematic literature review (Budgen and Brereton, 2006; Brereton et al., 2007; Kitchenham et al., 2009). This paper reviews existing state of the art tools and techniques of test case generation. In this section, authors have summarized the research methods used to perform systematic review covers the review process, research questions, review search and selection criteria. The objective is to mention the highlighted points of existing literature and summarize the available research work in test case generation domain. 2.1 Review Process As suggested by Brereton et al. (2007), the review process has been conducted in three phases: Planning, Conducting and Reporting. In the planning phase following activities has been performed: (i) Analyze the need of literature review. (ii) Develop a variety of the research questions to address the need. (iii) Designing the objectives of the review process. In conducting phase following activities has been performed: (i) Designing search criteria (ii) Define review data selection criteria, (iii) Review selection procedure including inclusion & exclusion selection criteria and selection of the data from existing literature. Finally, in reporting phase following activities has been performed: (i) Reports have been prepared which includes findings of results with discussion in various forms such as tables, graphs & descriptions. The objective of overall review process is to answers the research questions with evidences, identify research gaps and achieve the objectives which may help in future research work (Petersen et al., 2007). While performing this literature review, following guidelines have been followed (Budgen and Brereton, 2006; Kitchenham et al., 2009). This process involved following steps: ➢ Selection of different e-databases from where the primary research papers were collected. ➢ Design a search string to capture all related publications. ➢ Defining inclusion & exclusion criteria for selection of related publications. ➢ Designing quality research questions to assess the quality of related papers to fulfil the objective of the review. ME Verma et al.: Software Test Case Generation Tools and Techniques: A Review 296 | Vol. 8, No. 2, 2023 Figure 2. Critical literature review process. 2.2 Research Questions Test case generation process is suffering from various challenges. To identify and analyze the impact of such challenges and their solutions, various research questions (RQ) have been developed. Six questions have been formed for analysis and synthesis purpose. These questions were formed to analyze the research gaps and identify the main aspects in the development and design of test case generation research domain. The authors have framed following research questions to analyze the literature and conclude to concrete outcome. The lists of framed research questions for this study are mentioned below: RQ1: How Test Case Generation techniques are different from each other? RQ2: Are there any standard programs or datasets available to perform basic test case generation research? RQ3: What is the ratio of publishing research articles in conferences and journals of repute on test case generation? RQ4: Which type of testing has been explored a lot for research of test case generation? RQ5: What are the various tools developed and utilized for automatic test case generation? RQ6: What are the various optimization algorithms used for optimizing the results of test case generation process?

Table 1. Selected digital libraries for papers. Digital Library URL Google Scholar https://scholar.google.com/ IEEE https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ Springer https://link.springer.com/ ACM https://dl.acm.org/ Elsevier https://www.elsevier.com/ Wiley https://www.wiley.com/ During searching process, related search keywords have been selected to prepare the search strings. An accurate and systematic approach for searching has been developed. The following steps have been comprised to select publications using search keywords. • The literature of test case generation has been explored and most repeated keywords are selected for searching more articles. • Explore matching string, alternative keywords and similar words that frequently used. • Design search strings by using AND, OR and NOT operators and apply in search engines. • At last, manually verify the searched publications that the research papers are related to the research questions formed for literature review. The titles of few of the searched papers were not relevant to this study, so these papers have been discarded. In second step, the abstract & conclusion of the selected papers has been analyzed, if the paper is found reverent to the study, then include these papers otherwise discard it. The related search strings and alternate keywords used for this study are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Related search string for automatic search. S.

Now, finally 125 papers found suitable for critical review process. Figure 5. Selection procedure of primary studies. 3. Results and Discussion As software testing having various activities, generation of test cases is one of the crucial and important activity, as it has a robust impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process (Zhu et al., 1997; Bertolino, 2007) Test Case Generation is an activity in which test cases are generated either manually or automatically by using any automatic test case generation tool (Prasanna et al., 2011; Avdeenko and Serdyukov, 2021). This section provides the answer of the research questions formed in this study based on the papers collected in the previous section. To answer of research questions, the relevant evidences of existing literature has been used, which will help the researchers of the domain of test case generation.

It became clear that there exists different type of test case generation techniques such as model based, random based, search-based, specification based and metamorphic software testing approach. Figure 6 and Table 4 further differentiate the various approaches of test case generation and discuss their advantages & disadvantages. Figure 6. Test case generation techniques. Table 4. Descriptions of test case generation techniques. Name of Technique Description of Technique Advantages Disadvantages References of Technique Model- Based Generation Model-based testing is a technique in which the test cases are generated automatically from application models written in EFSM (Extend Finite-State Machine). Such models consist of business logic & is just a few lines of code. (1) Communication improvements. (2) More Cost- Effective. (1) Increasing Complexity (2) Adaptation To the New Approach (Pǎsǎreanu et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2012; Enoiu et al., 2013; Shirole and Kumar, 2013; Nabuco ans Paiva, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Fellner et al., 2019) Random- Testing based Random-testing method involves creating random and independent inputs to test programmes. It's a sort of black-box testing. The output created is compared to the software specifications to see whether the outcome is correct or not. (1) Do not require to know programming languages. (2) it is cheaper, simpler and easier. (1) Many of the tests are redundant and unrealistic. (2) More time is spent on analysing results. (Liu et al., 2010; Zhou, 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Ramler et al., 2012; Bala Mishra et al., 2017; Wetzlmaier and Ramler, 2017; Lemberger, 2020) Search- Based Software Testing The process of utilizing search techniques to solve testing problems in the software is known as Search- Based Software Testing (SBST). SBST is a tool for creating test data, prioritising test cases, reducing test suites, and optimising software test oracles, among other things. (1) It is very quick, efficient to implement and faster in execution. (2) It gives a sense of the landscape structure. (1) Poorly defined requirements. (2) Some possible inputs will only be tested. (Harman, 2007; Ali et al., 2010; Mairhofer et al., 2011; Devasena and Valarmathi, 2012; Varshney and Mehrotra, 2013; Rojas et al., 2015; Dave and Agrawal, 2015; Panichella, 2019; Scalabrino et al., 2021) Specificatio n based Test cases are derived directly from the specification or another model of what the system should perform in a specification-based technique. (1) Test cases are independent of implementation. (2) Development of test cases have done in parallel with the implementation. (1) Substantial redundancies may exist in between test cases. (2) Possibility of gaps of untested software. (Fraser and Gargantini, 2009; Brucker et al., 2011; Vasilache, 2016; Ed-Douibi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Sato, 2020) Metamorphi c Testing Metamorphic testing technique is to test programmes without the use of an oracle has been proposed. It uses metamorphic relations, which are features of the target function, to produce follow-up test cases and automatically validate the results. (1) Simplicity in concept. (2) Straightforward implementation. (1) No proper framework for verification, validation, and quality assessment. (2) Metamorphic relations should not be formally described.

Many software developments, testing and test case generation approaches have evolved in last two decades to deliver quality products and services. Testing plays a vital role to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. In this paper authors attempted to conduct a systematic study of testing tools and techniques. Six most popular e-resources called IEEE, Springer, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Elsevier, Wiley and Google Scholar to download 738 manuscripts out of which 125 were selected to conduct the study. Out of 125 manuscripts selected, a good number approx. 79% are from reputed journals and around 21% are from good conference of repute. Testing tools discussed in this paper have broadly been divided into five different categories: open source, academic and research, commercial, academic and open source, and commercial & open source. The paper also discusses several benchmarked datasets viz. Evosuite 10, SF100 Corpus, Defects4J repository, Neo4j, JSON, Mocha JS, and Node JS to name a few. Aim of this paper is to make the researchers aware of the various test case generation tools and techniques introduced in the last 11 years with their salient features. Keywords- Software testing, Test case generation, Test data, Software reliability, Software engineering. 1. Introduction Software industry is very dynamic, uncertain and volatile, since 19th century to till date new software trends are taking place to meet the growing needs of customers. But throughout this tenure, the quality and reliability of software have always been a prime focus. The increasing dependency of society on the daily use of the software is making software reliability a more important aspect. The reliability of software mainly depends on software testing. Better software testing may lead to more reliable software. Software Testing is a process of applying existing or new test cases on software for verification during development and for validation of functionality before release. Testing time is an essential key factor that depends on the scope and complexity of the software. It is identified that testing consumes more than 50% software development time as it involves various activities. Testing activities include the following tasks: generation of test cases, forming test suites, execution of test suites, analyze the results of the execution and prepare the report of testing activity (Baresi and Pezzè, 2006; Setiani et al., 2019). ME Verma et al.: Software Test Case Generation Tools and Techniques: A Review 294 | Vol. 8, No. 2, 2023 The main of test case generation is to make test suites for detecting bugs in the software. These test cases and test suites will ensure that the system satisfies the reliability, standards, and customer requirements of the software. The test case generation approach contains four main activities: information artifacts, generation mechanism, test case validity and formation of test oracle. These activities are used to represent the basic test case generation process shown in Figure 1 (Clark et al., 2021). Figure 1. Basic test case generation process. In practicality, a test case generator is a software program that takes a source code of software to be tested, test case validation criteria, test case specifications and basic data structure definitions of test cases as input parameters and generates test cases as output. Test case generation algorithms use heuristics or some explicit strategy to generate test cases which maximize code coverage or fault coverage capabilities of test cases. According to literature , generating accurate test cases which can fulfil the test requirements is not an easy task (Narciso et al., 2014). In last decade so many researches have been done in the area of test case generation. So, it became necessary to review these important literatures for better classification of approaches and identification of research gaps. This paper provides a systematic review to present a broad overview of the existing literature on test case generation tools and techniques since 2011. The motivation behind the paper is to focus on evidences for identification of research gap in test case generation tools and techniques. To perform the review process, authors have included almost all the important literature and presented them in a well-organized manner. This review has been conducted on a set of 125 papers published in conference and journals of repute between year 2011 and 2021. The selection of these papers is done using multistage selection criteria in the field of test suite generation. Followed by introduction, the structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2, describes the research methods for systematic mapping of existing work which includes the process of review, research questions, search criteria, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and selection procedure for research articles. Section 3 discussed the results and provide the answers of research questions with proper evidences. At last, Section 4 presented the conclusions of the systematic review as well as identifies the future scope for the current study. ME Test Data validity Test Case] Test Casc?

Research Methods for Systematic Mapping of Literature Review In last decade, researchers have contributed a lot on test case generation to make the generation process more efficient and truly automated. Systematic review is the way to look back to the studies. It is a rigorous and consistent practice for identifying and classifying related research as much as possible and also focus on selection of relevant findings, analyse data, and perform evaluation or assessment (de Almeida Biolchini et al., 2007). There are some slandered guidelines to conduct systematic review, such guidelines provide the steps to perform systematic review. The authors have followed these guidelines conduct an effective systematic literature review (Budgen and Brereton, 2006; Brereton et al., 2007; Kitchenham et al., 2009). This paper reviews existing state of the art tools and techniques of test case generation. In this section, authors have summarized the research methods used to perform systematic review covers the review process, research questions, review search and selection criteria. The objective is to mention the highlighted points of existing literature and summarize the available research work in test case generation domain. 2.1 Review Process As suggested by Brereton et al. (2007), the review process has been conducted in three phases: Planning, Conducting and Reporting. In the planning phase following activities has been performed: (i) Analyze the need of literature review. (ii) Develop a variety of the research questions to address the need. (iii) Designing the objectives of the review process. In conducting phase following activities has been performed: (i) Designing search criteria (ii) Define review data selection criteria, (iii) Review selection procedure including inclusion & exclusion selection criteria and selection of the data from existing literature. Finally, in reporting phase following activities has been performed: (i) Reports have been prepared which includes findings of results with discussion in various forms such as tables, graphs & descriptions. The objective of overall review process is to answers the research questions with evidences, identify research gaps and achieve the objectives which may help in future research work (Petersen et al., 2007). While performing this literature review, following guidelines have been followed (Budgen and Brereton, 2006; Kitchenham et al., 2009). This process involved following steps: ➢ Selection of different e-databases from where the primary research papers were collected. ➢ Design a search string to capture all related publications. ➢ Defining inclusion & exclusion criteria for selection of related publications. ➢ Designing quality research questions to assess the quality of related papers to fulfil the objective of the review. ME Verma et al.: Software Test Case Generation Tools and Techniques: A Review 296 | Vol. 8, No. 2, 2023 Figure 2. Critical literature review process. 2.2 Research Questions Test case generation process is suffering from various challenges.

It became clear that there exists different type of test case generation techniques such as model based, random based, search-based, specification based and metamorphic software testing approach. Figure 6 and Table 4 further differentiate the various approaches of test case generation and discuss their advantages & disadvantages. Figure 6. Test case generation techniques. Table 4. Descriptions of test case generation techniques. Name of Technique Description of Technique Advantages Disadvantages References of Technique Model- Based Generation Model-based testing is a technique in which the test cases are generated automatically from application models written in EFSM (Extend Finite-State Machine). Such models consist of business logic & is just a few lines of code. (1) Communication improvements. (2) More Cost- Effective. (1) Increasing Complexity (2) Adaptation To the New Approach (Pǎsǎreanu et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2012; Enoiu et al., 2013; Shirole and Kumar, 2013; Nabuco ans Paiva, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Fellner et al., 2019) Random- Testing based Random-testing method involves creating random and independent inputs to test programmes. It's a sort of black-box testing. The output created is compared to the software specifications to see whether the outcome is correct or not. (1) Do not require to know programming languages. (2) it is cheaper, simpler and easier. (1) Many of the tests are redundant and unrealistic. (2) More time is spent on analysing results. (Liu et al., 2010; Zhou, 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Ramler et al., 2012; Bala Mishra et al., 2017; Wetzlmaier and Ramler, 2017; Lemberger, 2020) Search- Based Software Testing The process of utilizing search techniques to solve testing problems in the software is known as Search- Based Software Testing (SBST). SBST is a tool for creating test data, prioritising test cases, reducing test suites, and optimising software test oracles, among other things. (1) It is very quick, efficient to implement and faster in execution. (2) It gives a sense of the landscape structure. (1) Poorly defined requirements. (2) Some possible inputs will only be tested. (Harman, 2007; Ali et al., 2010; Mairhofer et al., 2011; Devasena and Valarmathi, 2012; Varshney and Mehrotra, 2013; Rojas et al., 2015; Dave and Agrawal, 2015; Panichella, 2019; Scalabrino et al., 2021) Specificatio n based Test cases are derived directly from the specification or another model of what the system should perform in a specification-based technique. (1) Test cases are independent of implementation. (2) Development of test cases have done in parallel with the implementation. (1) Substantial redundancies may exist in between test cases. (2) Possibility of gaps of untested software. (Fraser and Gargantini, 2009; Brucker et al., 2011; Vasilache, 2016; Ed-Douibi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Sato, 2020) Metamorphi c Testing Metamorphic testing technique is to test programmes without the use of an oracle has been proposed. It uses metamorphic relations, which are features of the target function, to produce follow-up test cases and automatically validate the results. (1) Simplicity in concept. (2) Straightforward implementation. (1) No proper framework for verification, validation, and quality assessment. (2) Metamorphic relations should not be formally described. (Tao et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Hui and Huang, 2013; Bandaru and Albert Mayan, 2016; Saha and Kanewala, 2018; Lv et al., 2018; Segura et al., 2020; Asyrofi et al., 2021) Test Case Generation Techniques Specification based Model-Based Generation Random-Testing based Search-Based Software Testing Metamorphic Testing ME Verma et al.: Software Test Case Generation Tools and Techniques: A Review 301 | Vol. 8, No. 2, 2023 Answer to RQ2 During the review processes it becomes clear that many of researchers have utilized various standard datasets and sample programs to validate their test case generation approaches. Table 5 shows the brief details of dataset utilized in Test Case Generation. Table 5. Details of dataset utilized in test case generation.
